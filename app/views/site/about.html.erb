  <p>Corpora is a new platform that brings together humanities and science professionals, developers, metadata
    specialists, and librarians to develop new ways to search, cross-reference, visualize and interpret multimedia
    collections.</p>
  <p>Corpora enhances organization and discovery within multimedia repositories. The Corpora platform segments, indexes
    and cross-references audio-visual-transcript materials, allowing users to uncover new knowledge through granular and
    comparative searches, and through geo-spatial analysis. Corpora is a collaborative effort to share resources and
    best practices in the areas of application development, metadata, data sharing, data licensing, and data sources in
    support of multimedia repositories. Please contact <a href="mailto:corpora@tufts.edu">corpora@tufts.edu</a> for more
