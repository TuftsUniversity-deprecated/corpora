<u>Ayesha Jalal: Well Thank you very much, and welcome all of you to the course of lectures in the series that we are doing on Islam and the Indian Ocean Rim and I am Ayesha Jalal really it&#8217;s a pleasure to welcome Seema Alavi, Professor Seema Alavi who&#8217;s really no stranger to Tufts, she is in fact an intrinsic part of Tufts whenever we hold conferences. </u>

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_2" n="2" end="timepoint_3">
<u>It&#8217;s impossible not to have her around and I am really very, very delighted that she agreed after some reluctance to accept the invitation to come and speak to us whilst she was in this area while we were just taking advantage of her presence in the Boston area to get her across and come in and give us a lecture which some of you will know.</u>

<u>We are recording a spring course that Kris Manjapra and I myself are teaching. I will be teaching it at Lahore at LUMS and Kris [Kris Manjapra] will be teaching it at Tufts. The series has been made possible by a grant from the Provost&#8217;s Office office called The Tufts Collaborates and also this event has been made possible by our co sponsors in the History Department and organizationally I owe gratitude to Juhi Shahin and to Bilal Baloch as well.</u>

<u>Seema Alavi as some of you no doubt know that she is Professor of History at the Delhi University and she previously was at the Jamia Milia but she has held several very prestigious fellowships in UK at Cambridge, at Harvard here and so it&#8217;s been possible for us to keep in touch constantly really over the past several years.</u>

<u>She is an expert on early Modern South Asia and really it&#8217;s impossible to understand the transition to Colonialism without referring to Seema&#8217;s [Seema Alavi] extraordinarily important work. Her first she was educated at Cambridge she did her PhD there and her PhD turned book called &#8220;The Sepoys and the Company: Tradition and Transition in Northern India 1717 to 1780&#8221; </u>

<u>was an important intervention in the field and it went against the grain of existing scholarship which emphasized continuity in Military traditions from the late Mughal period and the early colonial period in the 18th century and her work has been extraordinarily influential it looks at a wide array of factors and the role of the Military really I mean the Bengal army, the colonial States army in India. </u>

<u>Her most recent book &#8220;Islam and healing, loss and recovery of an Indo-Muslim medical tradition 1600 to 1900&#8221; was published by Palgrave MacMillan in the year 2008. It&#8217;s a superb history of the Unani tradition of Indo Muslim medicine in India [Unani medicine]. It&#8217;s an extraordinary work because she uses a ray of sources Arabic, Persian and Urdu to challenge some common place views of medical,</u>

<u>of medicine really. She shows that medicine in the Unani tradition [Unani medicine] certainly was just not about the biological, about the biological entity but body but was incorporated a whole array of things including ethics questions of virtue and proper conduct and of course she has done a lot of other things, she has written a number of path breaking articles</u>

<u>Seema Alavi: Thank you so much Ayesha [Ayesha Jalal] for this extremely generous and nice introduction. It&#8217;s always a pleasure for me to come to this area and of course more of a pleasure to come to Tufts with Ayesha [Ayesha Jalal] and all her students, many of who I have got to know personally over the years.s</u>

<u>This talk is actually a kind of review a survey of all the works </u>
<u>that Ayesha [Ayesha Jalal] just mentioned and issues that have interested me over the last 10 to 15 years actually now and this is a way of revisiting some of the researches on the 18th century that I have done and kind of trying to put them in a new global frame. Basically, I am going to tell you 3 stories today and via those stories we will see how 18th century late Mughal decline was triggering some very interesting connections that South Asia was making with the world outside.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_11" n="11" end="timepoint_13">
<u>Let me start like most 18th century specialist with Mir Taqi Mir &#8220;is ahal ko na jane, agla sa ahla Mir who door ab nahin who zamana nahin, asman nahin&#8221;. This age is not like that which went before it the times have changed the Earth and sky has changed. As most of you would know this was the final lament of the 18th century Mughal poet Mir Taqi Mir who had spent a life time in Delhi </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_13" n="13" end="timepoint_14">
<u>enjoying the patronage of the Mughal Empire and living on the larges of the imperial court in Agra and Delhi. From the 1740&#8217;s he began to see the visible decline of the city of Delhi, it&#8217;s degradation in the hands of Afghan and Persian invaders the steadily rising political ambitions of the English East India Company and the loosening of the Imperial control as revenue from its far flung provinces slowly became a trickle. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_14" n="14" end="timepoint_14">
<u>While Mir demeaned the fading of Delhi he was skeptical of the whims of change that saw power and patronage shift to the provinces. Indeed the shrinkage of the old patrons had as many of you know made provincial centers havens of new literary energy. In 1780 Mir like many other Delhi litterateurs very grudgingly shifted to the provincial town of Lucknow, </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_14" n="14" end="timepoint_15">
<u>however his nostalgia of the Imperial capital continued and produced the famous poetry of lament sher ashow. Mir introduces himself to the people of Lucknow in a patronizing was that reflects the cultural arrogance of the archetype court Mughal poet &#8220;kya bhot baat puche ho purab ke sakiyon, Delli jo ek saher tha aal mein intequaab is ko phalak ne loot ke veeran kar diya, </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_15" n="15" end="timepoint_16">
<u>humko gharib jaan ke has has pukaar ke rehte the muntakab hi jahan roz waar ke hum rehne wale hain usi ujrey dayar ke&#8221;. Why do you mock at me and ask yourselves where do I come from you Easterners which is Lucknowites where I also belong. There was a city famed throughout the world where dwelled the chosen spirits of the age Delhi it&#8217;s name fairest amongst fair fate looted it </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_16" n="16" end="timepoint_16">
<u>and laid it desolate and to that rabid city I belong. Now Mir [Mir Taqi Mir] attributes the nasty fate of Mughal Delhi to the degeneration of the nobility and the corruption of office and he is not alone in his assessment of Imperial decay. His peer the Delhi poet Sauda [Mirza Rafi Sauda] echoes other similar sentiments, &#8220;Na rasm suleh ki samjhe na jang ka dastoor&#8221; this is his comment o Lukhnowites</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_16" n="16" end="timepoint_17">
<u>&#8220;jo in mein quadradan theh who huien inse dur&#8221;. The nobles do not know the art of making war nor peace while the wise among them have deserted them. Such was their contempt for the eastern provinces where they had moved. Now the trope of decline as you can see in these verses referred to in these verses contains several elements that were common to the Mughals</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_17" n="17" end="timepoint_18">
<u>and their contemporaries the Ottoman and the Western Roman Empires [Holy Roman Empire] which is the idea of degeneration and corruption of the body politic by luxuries sale of office on miscegenation. Now, some South Asianists have used this notion of decline quite literally and painted the 18th century as dark ages. Other revision studies have instead substituted decline with the idea of decentralization and transformation.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_18" n="18" end="timepoint_19">
<u>What I want to do this evening is that I want to focus on the critical role of the myth of decline in the creation of wider conceptual spaces that offered critical arenas to intellectual communities to connect in fresh ways to global influences. I feel that this triggered a shift in the understanding of the self and the State and atomized understanding that derived from wider intellectual frame replaced one that framed perceptions in merely aristocratic literary and political genres of the past. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_19" n="19" end="timepoint_20">
<u>The de-centering of the State in the 18th century narrative enables us to arrive at a more nuance genealogy of the evolution of the early modern political cultures as shaped conceptualized and understood by individuals who were weathering this imperial crisis. This longer history of the court or State conceptualized from below as it were it invests the discussion on the early colonial State with a Norbert Elias kind of long genealogy.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_20" n="20" end="timepoint_20">
<u>It challenges the Foucaultian [Michel Foucault] brand of 19th century exceptionally with its Euro centric gaze and allows us to move beyond the colonial frame and understanding the political and the cultural transitions that characterize 18th century India. Now I will now as I said begin with the 3 stories to illustrate via these 3 histories how the very illness </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_20" n="20" end="timepoint_21">
<u>and decline of the imperial body led to the creation of wider intellectual community occupying a newly envisioned conceptual space. One, that was marked notably by not merely by the impact of western forms but the passage of Knowledge within the global Indo Islamic ecumene itself.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_21" n="21" end="timepoint_22">
<u>Now, the 3 stories that I am going to tell you is about the families of Indo Persian Mughal physicians on which I did some work earlier. The communities of Men of religion in the 18th century and the world of soldiering which was extremely critical in the 18th century context and via these 3 narratives that now I am going to share with you I will these stories</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_22" n="22" end="timepoint_22">
<u>or these narratives themselves will reveal that the perceived dwindling of the Mughal court and its aristocratic culture became a trigger for wider social change in the 18th century. Now, let me begin then with the Indo Persian physicians commonly popularly called Hakims in the 18th century. Now, as many of you already know Medical knowledge as an exclusive was an exclusive family preserve</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_22" n="22" end="timepoint_23">
<u>in Mughal India knowledge was protected families were you know guarded out from medical knowledge. Knowledge was kind of protected in languages which were not easily accessible to most of the people namely Persian and the whole idea was that literary medical literature was really men for bibliophile is they were meant for imperial courts, they were meant for libraries&#8217; they were really not meant for access to ordinary people. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_23" n="23" end="timepoint_24">
<u>Now the reason of course for all of that was that Medical knowledge and people who practiced medical knowledge were extensions of the court and in a way in Mughal notions of governance body was equivalent to body politics and therefore theories of governance often as any of you would know made analogies to the physical body. The King as a healer was one of the very, </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_24" n="24" end="timepoint_26">
<u>very popular and common trope in the late 17th century or the 17th century Mughal political culture. Now, but from the early 18th century the shrinkage of Mughal patrimony and the fag end of the imperial innings began to dent this social equilibrium in which urbane literate service gentry families had enjoyed rank and status as mere guardians and producers of this very, </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_26" n="26" end="timepoint_27">
<u>very carefully guarded medical knowledge. Why because in the 18th century in the Persian language was used by the gentry to guard knowledge&#8217;s of Science, Medicine and wisdom began to be vernacularized. This was a consequence of regional assertion that itself was triggered by local perceptions of decline. Further the freshly introduced lithographic print culture by the European Missionaries in Bengal made access to exclusive texts possible and easy.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_27" n="27" end="timepoint_27">
<u>This did not bode well again for service gentry families, it threatened to break family monopolies over knowledge. Now, this manifestation of decline and its popular perception triggered the forging of new bonds and connections. Some older families began to lean towards the British and European reference for survival but many turned towards non-European references as well.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_27" n="27" end="timepoint_28">
<u>Indeed many in-house battle for control power status and profits of trade in this period of decline manifested themselves also as struggles over control of knowledge which is older canonical knowledge with a resort to doctrinal languages, the tapping of the global outreach and the learning that they embodied. Now this was most evident in the way that communities of high learning&#8217;s such as our Hakims [hakim] refashioned themselves. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_28" n="28" end="timepoint_29">
<u>Their stories in the period of decline revealed that they made use of Arabic the doctrinal language and its canonical literature as the new medium to preserve family knowledge and status as a consequence of all the regional assertions the vernacularization [vernacular], the threat to family monopolies that they were receiving.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_29" n="29" end="timepoint_30">
<u>And this shift from Persian to Arabic as I will now show had very far reaching implications as far as the global out reach of this late so called declining ad decaying of the Mughal political culture was concerned. Let me just illustrate this with a few texts. Persian medical texts the preserve of the Persian Mughal medical families were unique as I said in underscoring the idea of health as aristocratic virtue as individual well being. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_30" n="30" end="timepoint_31">
<u>They emphasized the salience of Individual comportment and proper conduct as central to personal well being. The Tib-i Dara Shikohi a very, very famous Mughal Unani [Unani medicine] text written by Nuruddin al-Shirazi a very, very important litterateur from the court of Shah Jahan is one such case and point namely this is a text which is 3000 folio long which by any standards is huge it&#8217;s ornate, </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_31" n="31" end="timepoint_33">
<u>it&#8217;s illustrative, it&#8217;s in Nastaliq Persian style which means more difficult to read than other styles of Persian and all this is meant, all this means that this is basically a text which barely has 2 or 3 copies and most of those the knowledge and the text is meant for bibiliophiles for court libraries and for the aristocracy.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_33" n="33" end="timepoint_34">
<u>Now, the tradition and also the whole size the aristocratic audience that the text is pitched to is all kind of tuned to tuned by its author Shirazi [Nuruddin al-Shirazi] to up hold the king&#8217;s authority as manager of the health of the people because it&#8217;s meant for a certain kind of aristocratic audience and for aristocratic consumption for Shirazi [Nuruddin al-Shirazi] health his about well being about aristocratic virtue</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_34" n="34" end="timepoint_35">
<u>and the ideal State that can be achieved by a select few through proper comportment. The text is exclusive and the conflation of the body with body politic is almost complete as because of its size the language in which it is written, the style, the way it excludes certain people and switched towards a very definite audience. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_35" n="35" end="timepoint_36">
<u>Now the tradition of writing Shirazi [Nuruddin al-Shirazi] style medical encyclopedias continued in the period of imperial crisis however this period also saw the shift to a new genre of medical literature that signaled the early symptoms of decline. In the early decades of the 18th century the Mughal physician Mohammad Akbar Shah Arzani produced a very modest as compared to the Tib-i Dara Shikohi very modest text of merely 48 folios.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_36" n="36" end="timepoint_38">
<u>Mizan-i-Tib or scales of medicine now this if you just compare it with the text I described of Shirazi [Nuruddin al-Shirazi] which was written in Shah Jahan&#8217;s period and Mizan-i-Tib which is written in late Aurangzeb&#8217;s period you can see a) the size from 3000 to mere 48 folios but more importantly this was also a text which was written in relatively easy to read Nastaliq style Persian. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_38" n="38" end="timepoint_39">
<u>Stylistically, and in its size it stands in sharp contrast to the voluminous or the late Persian medical text of the Shirazi [Nuruddin al-Shirazi] kind but the Mizan-i-Tib or the scales of medicine was kind of important and significant also because it moves or it bends more towards providing youthful medical knowledge which you can call wisdom in the 18th century context </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_39" n="39" end="timepoint_40">
<u>or Science rather than doses of aristocratic virtue as a guarantee of well being which was the case with the earlier text. The Mizan&#8217;s [Mizan-i-Tib] easy to read style and accessibility was triggered by quote unquote decline which meant in this context regional pressures for larger linguistic and cultural space within the Mughal political culture. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_40" n="40" end="timepoint_41">
<u>With its emphasis of its useful knowledge of Science and theology this text radiates the austerity and wisdom associated with doctrinal languages like Arabic so it was not in Arabic but it was modeled on the style of the Arabic texts which were more into scientist learning rather than aristocratic virtue. The Mizan-i-Tib claims to be a handbook of medicine claims very different claims </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_41" n="41" end="timepoint_42">
<u>than that being made in Shah Jahan time and for beginners not quite clearly it indicates not a text for Bibliophiles like its pre curser the Tib-i Dara Shikohi but as the text Mizan [Mizan-i-Tib] made family not the knowledge easy to access older families reacted by looking for new encasements for preserve their status. Now because of the imperial crisis because of pressures from the regions when medical texts of the Mizan [Mizan-i-Tib] </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_42" n="42" end="timepoint_43">
<u>began to be written which could be easily accessible obviously the protectors and the preservers the custodians of the earlier kinds of medical knowledge who were felt very threatened and their responses to this resulted in the use of Arabic as the new language of both sacred and profane knowledge. This was a step ahead of the mere Arabic Scientist turn that the Mizan-i-Tib had taken. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_43" n="43" end="timepoint_44">
<u>By the end of the 18th century the change was all too evident outside the capital of the post Mughal societies the dignity of Medical science had radically shifted from Persian in which it had rested since the time of the Mughals to Arabic which was projected as the custodian of the Arab Sciences by the late 18th century.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_44" n="44" end="timepoint_45">
<u>Arab medical literature continued to the Mizan&#8217;s [Mizan-i-Tib] trend of healing via nuggets of medical wisdom science rather than aristocratic virtue. Books in the private library of the 18th century notables and rulers like Tipu Sultan of Mysore or Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah of Awadh now included not just Persian texts but an equally large number of Arabic literary compendiums </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_45" n="45" end="timepoint_46">
<u>and commentaries on religion, medicine and science. Aloys Sprenger Assistant to the British resident at Lucknow who prepared one such major catalogue of books in private hands in Awadh vouched for this trend. The Arabic text on medicine for instance the Shar-i-Mujib rather than the Persian medical literature of the earlier century became the most popular text in the schools </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_46" n="46" end="timepoint_47">
<u>and libraries of 18th century north India. As elite families leaned on Arabic and the knowledge and prestige it embodied the change was easy to discern what was that in the late 18th century one could be a gentleman physician without having read a single Persian text of medicine. You could still qualify as a Hakim which was as I indicated not to be the case in high point of the Mughal period. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_47" n="47" end="timepoint_48">
<u>In the late Mughal period better known as regional assertion the drift towards the doctrinal language Arabic complicated the narrative of the formation of regional identities in the shadow of what I call an ill empire. But it fitted in with the general orientation of 18th century Indian society towards the new religious learning that was streaming in from Arab lands much more than before. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_48" n="48" end="timepoint_49">
<u>In the late 18th century the increased pilgrim traffics to Mecca and the improved transport facilities with the Arab world facilitated the entry of the Wahhabi inspired ideas of utilitarian styles, Arabic scriptures and the salient&#8217;s of the prophet into India. This gave religious knowledge a new austere and Arab orientation. Medical knowledge also succumbed to this trend.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_49" n="49" end="timepoint_50">
<u>In fact it came as a much needed bonus to be leaguered as Indo Persian professionals who looked for new encasements in which to preserve and shield medical knowledge from going public. Medical individual&#8217;s families and their clientele eager to protect family knowledge even if as medical wisdom in new kinds of texts used as Arabic and it&#8217;s esoteric classical stature. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_50" n="50" end="timepoint_51">
<u>Arabic was the universal language off Science at this point in time in the non-European world thus the shift to Arabic a wider ambit of literal and imaginary connections with the Islamic acumen. At the end of the Mughal innings when regional identities were sharply articulated in local languages it was Muslims of North India to a large extent who established the pan-regional links in Science, </u>

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_51" n="51" end="timepoint_52">
<u>medicine, astronomy and astrology in Arabic. This went parallel interestingly at this time to the Hindu efforts to consolidate their scientific legacy in Sanskrit and link up with the East and South East Asia on a scale never seen before. The long arms that stretched into the non-European imperials were a byproduct of the circulation of this idea of decline in the early 18th century.</u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_52" n="52" end="timepoint_53">
<u>Now, to my 2nd story on Men of Religion now one remarkable manifestation of the myth of decline was the production of a new kind of reformist literature by men of religion attached to the seminaries of Sunni Islam in Delhi and in Lucknow. As legatees of the Mughal empire they met the new challenges posed by the ill Empire and it&#8217;s political successor the English East India Company</u>

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_53" n="53" end="timepoint_54">
<u>by tapping both the indigenous resources as well as the networks laid out by the new English power. This enable them to gun a support establish contacts beyond the territories still fledging British India. Their efforts were by informed by re interpretation of the Arabic scriptures the Quran and the hadith that had global appeal. They invoked these texts and popularized them using the vernacular Urdu language within India and Arabic outside its confines. </u>

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_54" n="54" end="timepoint_55">
<u> Sorry, I forgot about my slide show, now, just to get back to the first story this is a slide of the Mughal emperor Babur being examined by a hakim and as you can see in this slide that it&#8217;s absolutely you know kind of impossible to figure out who noble is and who a Hakim is and that is what texts like the &#8220;Dara Shikohi&#8221; [Tib-i Dara Shikohi] that I was discussing the 3000 long folio text </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_55" n="55" end="timepoint_56">
<u>were actually kind of trying to achieve which is they were trying to conflate body and body politics in the ways in which Unani healing [Unani medicine] was to be understood and this text, this slide is again of aristocratic of medicines being prepared in the Mughal kitchen actually and you can see the aristocratic setting of even the preparation of medicines again. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_56" n="56" end="timepoint_57">
<u>This is the same idea of health being part of aristocratic virtue and now this is the Mizan-i-Tib the 2nd text that I discussed that period where you can see a drastic change from the way in which medicine, healing is going to be depicted this is a distillation of apparatus </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_57" n="57" end="timepoint_58">
<u>and so the text that you have will actually have images of you know technology that is being used rather than all the frills and fan fare of making medicines or you know curing, healing the Mughal emperor.

<u>and scientific knowledge spilled out of their bodily trappings. There was a greatest stress on the individual and its ability to create a doctrine that ensured universal appeal and promised global connectivity and some of this discussion that in this story links up to Professor Jalal&#8217;s [Ayesha Jalal] very influential work about the individual and the self for a later period.</u>

<u>So in a way this is like a prelude to much of what will happen in the late 19th century. Now this very distinct South Asian strand of Arabicist tradition became the hallmark of the turn of the century Urdu and Arabic literature. The reformist focused on the individual and his agency interpreting scripture. This added flexibility to the prescriptive decorum doled out to at shrines,</u>

Not surprisingly, this Arabisit tradition of return to the scripture and the salience of the individual opened a floodgate of individual energy. South Asian intellectual&#8217;s warrior&#8217;s traders and not just intellectuals but warriors and traders interpreted scriptures in individuated ways as they came to terms with the reality of the British rule.</u>

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_65" n="65" end="timepoint_66">
<u>It became an effective strategy to reap together diverse people by offering them unprecedented agency. This individuation was more than generally viewed as a ere self-purification exercise and I am referring here to the work of Barbara Metcalf of Frances Robinson who just leave it at that. Rather I would argue it was oriented more towards reaching out across the regional divide of India </u>

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_66" n="66" end="timepoint_57">

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_57" n="57" end="timepoint_57">
<u>Now let me turn to one popular text written in 1805 which kind of illustrates this trend. The &#8220;Nasihat al-Muminin&#8221; guide or advisory to Muslims was clearly a product of this new turn to individuation that I have been talking about. The &#8220;Nasihat&#8221; [Nasihat al-Muminin] authored by Karim Ali in 1810 exemplified an ordinary individual Karim Ali&#8217;s interpretation of the scriptures. </u>
</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_57" n="57" end="timepoint_58">
<u>What emerged was a text that deleted conspicuously the devotional aspects of Sufi leadership that characterized reformist literature of the Indo Persian reformists like Shah Waliullah himself. Instead in the &#8220;Nasihat&#8221; [Nasihat al-Muminin], there was a ban on all forms of devotion and rituals centered around in any one single leader. Tawhid believe in one Allah became the central pillar of this text</u>

<u>Now, the 3rd very important manifestation of the decline and the outward push that it generates can be seen in the realm of Military and this appeared in the form of increasing reliance of provincial Mughal elite on Europeans particularly French and German military entrepreneurs in the 18th century.

            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_99" n="99" end="timepoint_100">
<u>was accompanied by the emergence of new conceptual communities which occupied the space of former empires or expanded far beyond them.

<u>in the centuries that followed as somebody who spent a lot of time working on the 18th century this obviously is the critical question why study the 18th century.

<u>in the early periods still stands as a homogenous entity thanks to the post modern scholarship with its euro centric ways.

</u>
            <u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_102" n="102" end="timepoint_103">
<u>So it&#8217;s basically looking at decline through individuals. The Islamic acumen and its Arabist strand as well as the European and in this case French strand were two such cases in point.

<u>Now in terms of recruiting teachers to teach these languages it&#8217;s quite interesting that because of this transition and even this kind of bilingual this change in the bilingual tone as it were it is more difficult obviously to find teachers to teach in Arabic than to teach Persian.
